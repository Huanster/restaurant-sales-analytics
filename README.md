Restaurant Sales Analytics (MySQL · Data Cleaning · Power BI Dashboard)

This project analyzes messy restaurant transaction data to show how SQL, data cleaning, and visualization can be used to improve revenue, menu strategy, and staffing efficiency. The analysis is performed in MySQL, and insights are visualized in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The work includes:

- importing a real, intentionally dirty restaurant dataset from Kaggle,

- building a reproducible MySQL cleaning pipeline,

- analyzing sales and menu performance using SQL,

- and creating a clean, insight-driven Power BI dashboard for decision-making.

1. Business Context

Restaurants collect thousands of data points every week through POS systems—orders, items sold, timestamps, payment methods, and more. In reality, this data is often inconsistent, messy, or incomplete.

This project simulates the role of a restaurant data analyst and answers:

“When do customers buy, what drives revenue, and how can we improve staffing and menu performance?”

This project demonstrates:

SQL expertise: CTEs, joins, aggregates, string cleaning, date/time parsing

Data cleaning: standardizing categories, fixing invalid data, removing duplicates

Analytics: order-level metrics, menu performance, hourly demand patterns

Power BI visualization: KPI cards, heatmaps, category analysis, ranked menu items
